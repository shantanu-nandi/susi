<p class="h5 mb-4">
  An analog watch (American) or analogue watch (UK and Commonwealth) is a watch whose display is not digital but rather
  analog with a traditional clock face. The name is an example of a retronym; it was coined to distinguish analog
  watches, which had simply been called "watches", from newer digital watches.
