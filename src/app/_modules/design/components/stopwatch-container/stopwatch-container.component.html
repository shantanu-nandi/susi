<p class="h5 mb-4">
  A stopwatch is a handheld timepiece designed to measure the amount of time that elapses between its activation and
  deactivation. A large digital version of a stopwatch designed for viewing at a distance, as in a sports stadium, is
  called a stopclock. In manual timing, the clock is started and stopped by a person pressing a button. In fully
  automatic time, both starting and stopping are triggered automatically, by sensors.
