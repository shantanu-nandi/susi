      <p class="lead align-middle">Hi! My name is Shantanu Nandi, a passionate software engineer who enjoys building
        things that live on the internet. I develop websites, web apps and scallable backend services(API services,
        stream processing, and async mechanisms) using modern technologies. Strong in design and problem solving skills.
        I work well with teams and also adapt to changing environments and new technologies. And last but not least
        always focus is in writing clean, maintainable and testable code. And also I understand the value of formal education
        and I got one (I have a B.Tech in Information Technology) but I also believe in learning by doing. Here are a
        few technologies I've been working with recently: <span class="font-weight-bold">Javascript(ES6), Node.JS, HTML, (S)CSS, Angular,
        C#, Bootstrap, Express.JS.</span>
